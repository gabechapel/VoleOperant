1. autoshape1-0: Version 1 of the autoshaping timing experiment design
2. magazine1-0: Version 1 of the magazine timing experiment
3. version2-0: This is the original base code for how the device runs. All of the other .ino files are based on this one.
4. blackBox1-0: This script is the closest to the final one we will use. It simply acts as an input for when to dispense the pellet and sends out signals when the pellet is dispensed and taken.
